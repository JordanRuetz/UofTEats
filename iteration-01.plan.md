 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.

## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

* Complete deliverable 1 .md documents.
* Confirming our project goals. Our original product idea being non-profit option with RGP, however, after discussing requirements with RGP, they may not meet our course load expectations. Decision will be concluded by the review meeting.
* Figuring out what tools and software we need to complete project goals.
* Set team standards for what needs to be done personally (reviewing Android Studio) before programming starts

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* **product.md** - specifies product definition throughout all project work; can be added to.
* **User Stories** (See Azure Board) - working product definitions at different levels of detail; can be broken down and tracked with burndown chart.

 >* Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 >* Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 >* Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
