**SERVERS**:
* Able to update online menu
* Able to recieve digital order with payment
* No need to handle physical cash

    * Most common/intended user for the client app

### Highlights

* Decision not to pursue RGP project
    * After initial cutomer meeting, scope and technical difficulty were deemed not up to our standards and the course standards for what constitutes a substantial course project.
    * Unfortunately, the technical shortcomings of the project pushed us away from working with a nonprofit customer as we were hoping to pursue.
* Decision to integrate client and server apps into one unified application
    * Intended to unify branching and testing within our GitHub repo, as well as cut down on code reuse and redundancy in creating two similar Android apps.


> Decisions can be related to the product and/or the team process.
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Present the arguments for each alternative.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your team/product/users.
> Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product plan.
