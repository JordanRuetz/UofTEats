# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.

User Stories

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
