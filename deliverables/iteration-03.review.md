## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 28, 2018
 * Where: BA2220

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 1. More careful planning of sprint goals.  In iteration 3, we were careful to not take on more work than could be reasonably completed, which was a very sucessful decision because it allowed us to finish the project on time.  If we did not make this change, we likely would have tried to implement more features than we could not complete, which would have lead to a lot more bugs in our final product.
 
 2. The way we structured our GitRepo worked out well.  We structured the repo the same in iteration 2 and iteration 3 and it continued to be effective, allowing us to merge our code without issues and allowing our dev branch to only contain working code.  This was successful because as long as we followed the structure, we did not have to deal with a lot of merge conflicts and we never had broken and unworking code in any part of the repo that all members were contributing to.
 
 3. Our sprint meetings continued to be useful.  They allowed everyone to be aware of what was done, what needed to get done and what they were responsible for.  They were especially helpful when integrating between screens because all members could discuss how to integrate with the screens that they built, such as what needed to be passed as arguments.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Git comments did not work well.  This iteration proved to be worse than the previous in terms of people approving their own pull requests and no code was really reviewed.  This tended to happen because everyone felt that they had tested their code well and it worked well enough to put it in the dev branch without a review.  Team members also prioritized getting any working code into our dev branch over reviewing code because we knew that we had a very limited amount of time to complete the project and getting it working was the most important thing in the short term.

2. The azure board was not as effective as it was in iteration 2.  This is because that the team felt like they all knew what they were responsible for because for the most part it was similar to iteration 2 except they were working on the backend of their screens in stead of the frontend.  Also, because the iteration was not even 3 weeks long for us, everyone was able to be aware of their own and the teams weekly goals without a board, so it got updated pretty infrequently.  As a result, it was more difficult to tell where people were on their part of the project.

#### Planned changes

Although this was the last development iteration, if we were to continue working on the project, we would change:

1. We would make sure to review our code.  It would be easier to manage this in a long project because you would have more time to worry about quality instead of just getting an MVP as fast as possible.  Without code reviews the quality of code in our database would degrade until it becomes scary to change it in fear of breaking something.

2. We would better manage our azure board.  It turned out to not be important for us in the last iteration because we knew what we needed to get done each week to meet out goals, but in a long project we would want to be able to see our productivity and what tasks each team members was working on and how far they were towards completing them.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Firebase database was set up.  This allowed us to integrate screens with the database to pass information between clients and servers.  Database link: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/uoft-eats/overview Email: csc301database@gmail.com Password: csc301pass
 
2. Integrated all the screens with the database.  This allows the basic functionality of the app, such as displaying and editing menus, placing orders and creating accounts to work properly.  This is code in our repo.
 
3. Created a demo video, displaying our project.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGxFSZjI-HI&feature=youtu.be
 
4. Made some UI improvements.  This included better layout for our menu page and order confimation page and better alignment of headed for the orders page.  This is also code in our repo.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

For this iteration we made all of our planned goals.  This is because we planned our sprint goals better, as we aimed to in our plan for process changes.  If we had more time to work on the project we would add more features such as a more consistent UI across all screens, paypal integration and account recovery.

## Meeting Highlights

- The development iterations are now over.  We now need to prepare a presentation to show off our project and how it would benefit U of T students.  We will need to discuss how we plan to do the presentation.
- Our MVP is now finished!  Our app is functional and allows clients to view menus, place orders and see when they are ready to be picked up.  It allows for servers to edit menus, see placed orders and notify customers when they are ready to be picked up.  If we continue to develop this project, the next step would be to add paypal integration and a more consistent UI.
- In future development iterations and other projects, make sure to review code and also keep up the scrum board we are using.  Learning from the mistakes we have made so far, we know that doing this will make it easier to write clean, maintainable code and also manage our project better.
