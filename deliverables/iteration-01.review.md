# CSC301 FOOD TRUCK APP

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 11, 2018
 * Where: Wilbert's crib

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

> List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
> * 2 - 4 decisions.
> * Ordered from most to least important.
> * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
> * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


Re-evaluating ideas (from RGP and other ideas between team members) and settling down with our idea to create a food truck app.

 * After our initial call with RGP, we decided that the project was not technical or substantial enough for our course project.  Deciding to pursue our own idea instead of the RGP project allowed us to pick something that was large enough for our group.

Setup organizations: Communications, boards, setting up first meeting

 * Slack Channel
   * easy mode of communication for all members
   * helped us plan and organize our meetings
 * Azure agile board 
   * allows us to easily see what is being worked on
   * can see what our overall goals for the week are
   * can set the backlog with user stories to be completed

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

> List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 > * 2 - 4 decisions.
 > * Ordered from most to least important.
 > * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


The RGP assignment's level of difficulty did not match our course expectation well
 * Sticking to our own idea instead of trying to do a partner project would have saved us a lot of time

Timing with communicating with outside sources.
 * Trying to get everyone in the initial call with RGP pushed back the call to a later time


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 > * From most to least important.
 > * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 > * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

Confirmed our project goals
 * Created user stories in a backlog on the azure board and used that to figure out what we all need to complete for our project
 
Figured out what tools and software we needed
  * Using SQLite for our database
  * Using Android Studio to develop the app
  * Using a Slack Channel for communication
    * Slack invite link: https://join.slack.com/t/csc301-talk/shared_invite/enQtNDQ3NDk0OTI3MjE5LWM1ZmE2MGNmMTA3ZDg2YzM1NGQxZmYwNTlhODkxYjBhZmJlZTgzNmUxMDUzMDUxMDA3ODlhNDlhNDIwOWZlMTk
  * Using an Azure board for user stories and weekly sprint tasks

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 > * From most to least important.
 > * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
 >   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   
Did not have a group review of Android Studio
  * we decided to review it on our own time instead of as a group
   
## Meeting Highlights

 > * 2 - 4 items
 > * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 > * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 > * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 > * Can be related to product and/or process.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* We will use Android Studio for app development and SQLite for our database.
* We decided everyone will work on their own branch of development and create pull requests to the development branch when they finish a task.  At the end of sprints we will pull request to master.  This way unfinished tasks will not be in the development branch when we make a pull request to master.
* At the start of sprints we will decide which user stories that we should complete from the azure backlog and put their tasks on the azure board.  The azure board will let us know who is working on what and help us avoid working on the same thing or creating too many merge issues by working on the same files.
* Our goal is to have a reasonably working app by next deliverable, so we need to plan our limited number of sprints so that we will be able to meet that goal.
