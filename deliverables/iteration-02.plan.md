## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

Product Manager: Finnbarr
* Responible for knowing the roadmap of our project, making sure the we are accomplishing enough so that we finish on time.  Also responsible for feature definition, choosing which features are most important in our app and what we should not include based on our project goals.  Filmed and voiced demo video to present current state of the app and outline general value to users.

Scrum Master: Jordan
* Responsible for making sure the team follows processes and improving the process in order to make the team more effective.  Responsible for helping anyone with obstacles such as merge conflicts and responsibility uncertainty by communicating with them and calling meetings as necessary.  Also works with the product manager to make sure the backlog is in good shape.

Video Editor: Kara
* Responsible for editing the videos that the team produces to complete the deliverable on time.

#### Events

Since we are having weekly sprints, we are having a sprint planning and review meeting every Tuesday, to cap off one sprint and start the next. We will hold these meetings in SF2202.  The purpose of the sprint review meeting in to discuss what worked and what didn't over the last week and see what changes we need to make to our process.  It also allows everyone to stay in the loop with everything happening with the porject.  The purpose of the sprint planning meeting is to assign tasks that we want to achieve in the upcoming week, discuss how we will meet those goals and plan ahead for any obstacles we may have in doing them.

We also plan to have a prototyping meeting near the start of this iteration in one of the CS lab rooms in Bahen.  The purpose of this meeting is to plan the design of the app.  This way we can agree on what each screen of the app will look like so when different members design screens they will have a uniform look.

#### Artifacts
   
* Azure board
  * We will backlog tasks that need to get done on the Azure board.  At the start of a sprint we prioritize which tasks need to get doen during the week and then add them to our board for the week.  From the board we can see what is currently beign worked on, tested or is finished.  We will have a general discussion during the sprint planning meeting about who will work on what during the week and can assign tasks on the azure board based on this discussion.  This is flexible however, and may change depending on how much time each member can commit in a given week.  So we can reassign tasks during the week as needed.

  * (See Azure Board folder for screenshots)
* Slack Channel
  * Used for any communication between members, so everyone can see what is going on
* Github Repo
  * This is where code with be shared, merged and discussed in pull requests


#### Git / GitHub workflow

To manage our GitHub repository, we will create a dev branch of the master and from the dev branch every member will create their own branch for their development.  When a member is developing a feature or certain part of the project, they will commit their changes to their personal branch of the dev branch.  This way, there are not several sections of incomplete and non-working code in our dev branch.  When a member has finished a feature so that it works, then they will pull request from their branch to the dev branch.  Any other member will review the code and merge if the code looks good.  Otherwise, we can request for changes to be made before it is accepted into the dev branch.  At the end of the sprint we will pull request from the dev branch to the master branch, since we will have a larger set of working features to commit to our project.  We can give it a final look before we accept the pull request.  We chose this workflow because it allows us to work on features independently and only have finished features in the dev branch, avoiding many pieces of incomplete code in a part of the repo we are all using.  It also allows us to review each members code before accepting it into a repository that has code from everyone.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 1. Prototype the app using justinMind.  We will use the user stories to guide us in prototyping all the screens that we need in our app.  This is the most important because the prototypes will guide us in building the actual screen layouts.
 2. Use the prototypes to develop the actual layouts for the screens in flutter.  These will form the complete frontend for our app, ready to be integrated with the backend code.
 3. Complete various features of the backend, including setting up the database.  We plan to complete the first two goals as part of the first sprint at the start of the next sprint we will decide which backend features we will complete.  The backend tasks we choose to do will be based off of which user stories are the most important to have.
 
#### Artifacts

 1. **[A video](https://youtu.be/re57kHAOsbA__)** demoing our work up to the end of iteration 2.  This is a required part of deliverable 2.
 2. The prototypes and layouts for all the screens of our app.  The prototype is useful so different people working on different screens in the app have a common reference for what the app should look like.  THe prototypes will allow us to present what the project will look like.  The prototypes are stored on the GitHub repo in a folder called prototypes.
 3. The code for the layout of the screens of the app.  This will allow us to simulate someone using our app for the demo video that we need to do.  It also allows us to code the backend, hooking it up to the layouts we create.
 4. Screenshots of our Azure board to give a view of our workflow.
